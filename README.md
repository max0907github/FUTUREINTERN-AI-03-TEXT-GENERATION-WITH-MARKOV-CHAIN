# Text Generation with Markov Chains

## Overview
This project implements text generation using Markov Chains based on a dataset of prompts and generated responses.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `markovify`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

    ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells in order to load the dataset and generate text.
3. The generated responses will be saved in `markov_generated_responses.csv`.

## Dataset
The dataset used is `ManaGPT-1020_4080_prompts_and_generated_texts.csv`, which contains various prompts and their associated generated responses.
